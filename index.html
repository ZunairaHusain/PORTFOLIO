                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Zunaira Husain, a motivated third year Diploma in Computer Engineering student with a passion for technology and a commitment to helping others succeed. My journey in computer engineering has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming, software development, and hardware design. I have experience with languages such as C, C++, Java, as well as web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    In addition to my studies, I have the privilege of serving as a Placement Coordinator at Computer Engineering Section. In this role, I work diligently to bridge the gap between students and the industry. I organize placement drives, collaborate with companies, and provide guidance to my peers on resume building and interview preparation. My goal is to empower fellow students to enhance their employability and confidently step into their careers.

                    Looking ahead, I am eager to gain practical experience through internships and real-world projects. I am excited to connect with industry professionals and like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology. </p>

            <p> A personalised android-based estate application, designed to redefine the way tenants find flats and rooms, and how property owners list their properties for rent or sale. This app combines a fully responsive and user-friendly experience with powerful features that cater to both tenants and property owners, making it an indispensable tool in the real estate market.</p>
            <li><strong>Portfolio Website:</strong> </li>
            <p>The Personal Portfolio Website is a responsive and visually appealing platform designed to showcase my skills, projects, and educational background. Built using HTML and CSS, this website serves as a digital resume and an interactive showcase of my work.</p>
            <li><strong>Library Management system:</strong> </li>
            <p>The Library Management System overviews the concept of storing and generating all the data or records of the book contained within the library. This can be known as a general database which stores the data of the book details. It helps in searching the details by reducing time consumption. Not only protects the details of the books in the library but also saves all the data up to date without missing any. This is the major benefit of the Library Management System.</p>
